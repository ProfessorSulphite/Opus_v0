      "a": "Correct. The relatively low boiling point of ethanol (about 78°C) means it cannot be used to measure temperatures at or above this point, such as the boiling point of water.",
      "b": "Incorrect. The very low freezing point is an advantage, as it allows the thermometer to be used in very cold conditions where mercury would freeze.",

      "b": "Incorrect. While it's not a great conductor, this is not the primary reason it's unsuitable.",
      "c": "Correct. Water exhibits anomalous expansion; it contracts when cooled until 4°C, and then begins to expand as it cools further to its freezing point at 0°C. This non-linear and non-uniform expansion makes it completely unsuitable for creating a reliable thermometer scale.",

    "answer": "a",
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Correct. A thermocouple has a very low thermal mass (it's just a junction of two thin wires). It responds almost instantaneously to temperature changes because it requires very little energy to change its own temperature. It also generates an electrical signal that can be easily recorded.",
      "b": "Incorrect. A liquid-in-glass thermometer has a large thermal mass (the glass and the liquid) and takes time to reach thermal equilibrium, making it slow to respond.",

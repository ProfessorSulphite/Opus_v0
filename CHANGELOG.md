# Opus_v0 Refactoring Changelog

This document details the major refactoring and improvements made to the Opus_v0 application.

## Phase 1: Backend Foundation & Stability

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Critical Analytics Bug:** Fixed a `TypeError` in the database query logic for analytics (`func.case`) that was causing server errors. The `case` statements in `app/crud/analytics.py` and `app/crud/question.py` were updated to a more robust syntax, ensuring analytics and chapter summary endpoints function correctly.

### üîí Security & Configuration

- **CORS Policy:** Replaced the insecure `allow_origins=["*"]` configuration in `main.py` with a setting that properly uses the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` list from the environment configuration. This restricts API access to only trusted frontend domains.
- **Database URL:** Removed the hardcoded, absolute database path in `app/core/config.py`. The database URL is now dynamically and portably constructed based on the project's root directory, making the application easier to set up and run in different environments.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Code Quality

- **ORM Refactoring:** Refactored the `get_chapter_summary` function in `app/crud/question.py` from a raw SQL query (`db.execute(text(...))`) to use the SQLAlchemy ORM. This improves code readability, maintainability, type safety, and makes the application less dependent on a specific database dialect.

## Phase 2: UI/UX Transformation

### ‚ú® New User Interface

- **Complete UI Overhaul:** The previous frontend (`index.html`, `styles/`, `js/`) was completely removed and replaced with a new Single Page Application (SPA) structure.
- **Modern Design Integration:** The new frontend is built upon the provided modern UI design files. The `login.html`, `dashboard.html`, `practice.html`, `analytics.html`, and `settings.html` have been integrated into a cohesive SPA experience.
- **SPA Structure:** A new `index.html` was created to act as the main container, with page content loaded dynamically into a main content area from `<template>` tags. This improves performance and maintainability.
- **Robust Event Handling:** The frontend JavaScript (`app.js`) was completely refactored to use a robust event delegation pattern. This fixes the initial "white screen" bug and ensures all interactive elements work correctly, even when loaded dynamically.

### üé® Themeing

- **Light & Dark Mode:** A theme toggle has been implemented, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes. The application respects the user's system preference by default and saves their choice in local storage.

## Phase 3: Feature Implementation

### üîë Authentication

- **Real Authentication Flow:** The frontend now communicates with the backend for a full login/signup workflow. The mock logic has been replaced with actual API calls to `/api/v1/auth/login` and `/api/v1/auth/register`.
- **Token Management:** The JWT access token received from the backend is now securely stored in local storage and automatically included in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API requests.
- **User State:** After login, user information is fetched from the `/api/v1/auth/me` endpoint and stored within the app, allowing for a personalized experience (e.g., "Welcome, [User]!").
- **Persistent Login:** The application now checks for a stored token on startup, allowing users to remain logged in between sessions.

### üìä Dynamic Dashboard

- **Live Data:** The dashboard is no longer static. It now fetches and displays real user analytics data from the `/api/v1/analytics/` endpoint.
- **Statistics:** Key statistics cards (Total Questions, Average Score, Time Spent) are now populated with live data from the user's profile.
- **Chart Integration:** The Chart.js library has been added, and the "Accuracy by Chapter" bar chart is now rendered dynamically with data fetched from the backend.

### üèãÔ∏è Practice Page

- **Full Practice Flow:** The practice page is now fully functional.
- **Filter Population:** The "Chapter" and "Difficulty" dropdown filters are dynamically populated by fetching data from the backend API endpoints.
- **Question Loading:** Users can now start a practice session by selecting filters and clicking "Start Practice". Questions are fetched from the backend and displayed one by one.
- **Answer Submission:** The entire answer-check-feedback loop is implemented. Users can submit an answer, receive immediate visual feedback (correct/incorrect), and automatically advance to the next question.
